            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
            that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
            prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
            programming styles.

            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
            front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on
            components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
            community of individual developers and companies. React can be used
            to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with
            frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the
            user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React
            applications often rely on libraries for routing and other
            client-side functionality.

            Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by the
            private company Vercel providing React-based web applications with
            server-side rendering and static website generation. React
            documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains"
            advising it to developers when "building a server-rendered website
            with Node.js". Where traditional React apps can only render their
            content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this
            functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side.

            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can
            run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end
            JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript engine,
            and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets
            developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
            server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the
            server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the
            page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js
            represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying
            web-application development around a single programming language, as
            opposed to using different languages for the server- versus
            client-side programming.
